## Modules in Detail

Each chosen module was selected to enhance the project’s educational value and gameplay experience.

### I - Web

#### 3. Minor: Use a backend framework (Fastify) (1 pt)

- **Motivation**: It was a major module of the accient subject.

- **Details**:
	- Fastify API helps to communicate between frontend and backend.

- **PIC**: edelanno, layang, nrontard, pmenard and tat-nguy


#### 4. Major: Implement real-time features using WebSockets or similar technology (2 pts)

- **Motivation**: Sockets are required to enable live chat functionality and are preferred for games and tournaments due to their higher stability between clients and better efficiency compared to traditional REST APIs.

- **Details**:
	- WebSockets are used for the following features:
		- Chat: real-time message exchange, including message history.
		- Game: complete game management (paddles, ball, countdown, etc.), detailed in the game module.
		- Tournament: links four users to a tournament and ensures reliable handling of disconnections, detailed in the tournament module.
	- Backend and frontend communicate smoothly using listeners `.on` and triggers `.emit`.
	- All transmitted data is secured using JWT authentication (detailed below).
	- User status is automatically updated when the page is closed.

- **PIC**: pmenard and edelanno


#### 5. Major: Allow users to interact with other users (2 pts)

- **Motivation**: We chose this module because it contains important and relevant features for a gaming platform.

- **Details**:
  - Basic chat system:
    - We implemented a general chat that allows users to communicate with all other connected users.
    - WebSockets enable real-time chat, available across all pages once the user is connected.
    - To ensure persistence, messages are stored in a database, with a limit of 25 messages.
    - Messages are displayed in one color when a member sends a message and in another color when they receive one.
    - Multiple connections are also handled: if a user connects from multiple devices, the message bubbles remain consistent, and each message appears only once.

  - The friends page is divided into four sections:
    - search bar: to add users – includes a debounce function to avoid excessive database calls.
    - friends list: displays avatar, status (online/offline...), friendship date, and a button to delete a friend.
    - pending invitations: display username, avatar, and request date (if less than 3 days: displayed as x seconds, x minutes, x hours, or x days ago), with accept/deny and delete buttons.
    - friend suggestions: other users with whom games have been played, limited to 20 suggestions.
    - SQL queries are used to build this page. The Friend table, which associates two users with information about their friendship (date, status), and the game_info table, used for friend suggestions, provide the necessary data to build this page.
   
  - Profile system:
    - All user information are shown on the Profile page.
    - Users have a profile page displaying all their information such as username, password, email, avatar,...
    - User is also allowed to update their information and delete their own profile.
    - All user's information stores in table Users in the database.
   
- **PIC**: edelanno (chat, friend), tat-nguy (profile)


#### 8. Minor: A complete notification system for all creation, update, and deletion actions (1 pt)

- **Motivation**: To be clear and noramliazation at user side, upgrading user experience.

- **Details**:
	- use *Toast* notification, with typr: sucess, warning and error.
	- Duration personliazed and auto-string the source error message. 

- **PIC**: layang (edelanno, nrontard update with some feature updates)


### III - User Management

#### 1. Major: Standard user management and authentication (2 pts)

- **Motivation**: Enhance user experience and user engagement of the game.
  
- **Details**:
  - Users have a profile page displaying all their information
  - User is allowed to change their own information such as *Username*, *Password*, *Email*, *2FA Enable*, *Online Status*, *Avatar*...
  - User is also allowed to delete their own profile, this action can't be recover, so we ask user to write a request, confirm their password, make sure that it's not a mistake and they really want to delete. 
  - The first time register and login with Google Oauth, users are asked to set up a password immeditately.
  - Users can upload an avatar (with a default avatar if none provided). The avatar path is stored in the Users database. A default path is set initially. Each time the avatar is updated, it is renamed as user_id.type. Upload restrictions are enforced for file size and type.
  - Users can add other users as friends and see their online status. On the friends page, users can send friend requests and view their friends along with their status.

- **PIC**: edelanno, tat-nguy


#### 2. Minor: Game statistics and match history (requires a game module) (1 pt)

- **Motivation**:  We chose this module because it contains important and relevant features for a gaming platform.

- **Details**:
	- Player Statistics Tracking:

		I implemented multiple API requests to retrieve all relevant player data, including wins, losses, and rank, which are then dynamically displayed on the user dashboard. The player’s level is shown directly in the header, accompanied by a visual progression bar that reflects experience gained and overall advancement in real time.

	- Match History System:

		The DB stores a detailed match history for every player. For each 1v1 game, the following information is recorded and displayed:
	  	- Match date and time
		- Game mode (ranked, local, AI, etc.)
		- Final result (win or loss)
		- Opponent identity (player or AI)

	- Achievements and Progression:

		A dedicated achievement system was designed to reward player engagement and skill progression. Achievements can be:
	  	- Unlocked, locked, or secret
		- Based on specific conditions (number of wins, ranking reached, special accomplishments, etc.)
		- Common, rare, secret

	- Ranking and Leaderboard Integration:

		Competitive performance feeds directly into a leaderboard system, where players are ranked based on their accumulated ranking points. This provides:
	  	- A clear competitive hierarchy
		- Motivation through comparison with other players
		- Real-time reflection of player progression in the global ranking

### VI - Gaming and user experience

#### 1. Major: Implement a complete web-based game where users can play against each other (2 pts)

- **Motivation**: We started working on Transcendence about a month before the subject was updated. In the previous version of the subject, we were required to implement a Pong game, and we decided to continue in that direction by building upon the work we had already started.

- **Details**
	The backend is responsible for the entire game logic. It manages the positions of the paddles and the ball, the score, collision detection, and all game-related rules. It continuously sends the necessary game state data to the frontend, which is only responsible for rendering the game for each player.

	This architecture was chosen to ensure a more secure and fair gameplay experience, as it prevents players from manipulating the game state or cheating.

- **PIC**: pmenard, nrontard, layang


#### 2. Major: Remote players — Enable two players on separate computers to play the same game in real-time (2 pts)

- **Motivation**: From the very beginning, supporting remote players was an obvious choice for us. Our goal was to create a website that allows anyone to play on the same device against a friend, against an AI, or against another player using a different device.

- **Details**

	To support remote players, we initially started with a private API. However, we quickly realized that this approach was not well suited for real-time gameplay. We therefore switched to using WebSockets, which provide a more efficient and reliable way to handle real-time communication between players.

	The technical details of this implementation are further explained in the dedicated WebSocket module.

- **PIC**: pmenard


#### 7. Minor: Implement a tournament system (1 pt)

- **Motivation**: We believe that tournaments are a great addition to a game, as they introduce a stronger sense of competition and engagement for players.

- **Details**:
	The first player to join a tournament is designated as its creator. This player can either wait for other participants to join or start the tournament immediately, in which case any remaining slots are filled with AI players.

	To improve readability and user experience, we also added visual indicators using colors to clearly show match results and distinguish winners from losers.

- **PIC**: pmenard


#### 9. Minor: A gamification system to reward users for their actions (1 pt)

- **Motivation**: We chose this module because it contains important and relevant features for a gaming platform.

- **Details**:
	- 4 implementations:
	  	- Avhievements
		- XP/level system
		- leaderboards
		- badges

	- All data is persistently stored in the database, ensuring progress is maintained between sessions.

	- Visual feedback is provided through notifications and progress bars, giving users real-time updates on their achievements and progression.

	- Rules and progression mechanics are transparent: players can view clear rules before starting a game, ensuring a fair and understandable system.

- **PIC**: nrontard


#### 10. Minor: Implement spectator mode for games (1 pt)

- **Motivation**: We wanted to allow players who were eliminated from a tournament to watch the final match if they wished.

- **Details**:
	When the final match starts, an HTML button becomes available for eliminated players. By clicking on this button, they can join the game as spectators and watch the match in real time.

- **PIC**: pmenard


### VII - Devops

#### 1. Major Module: Monitoring system with Prometheus and Grafana (2 pts)

- **Motivation**: This helps monitoring the server system, analyzing performance and informing the team immediately when there's a trouble in operation of the server and used services.

- **Details**:
  - Set up Prometheus to collect metrics
    
    Prometheus was deployed as the central metrics collector (http://localhost:9090)
    
  - Configure exporters and integrations

    - Node Exporter for collecting host-level metrics (http://localhost:9101)
    - cAdvisor for collecting container-level metrics (http://localhost:8080)
    - Backend (Fastify / Node.js) for collecting application-level metrics (https://localhost:3000/metrics)

  - Create custom Grafana dashboards:

    Grafana helps visualize the metrics through these custom dashboards below:
    - **Operation System Dashboard**: Host CPU, memory disk, network usage
    - **Container Dashboard**: CPU, memory, IO, network, resource usage per container
    - **Backend Dashboard**: Heap usage, event loop lag, request rate, latency...
    - **Monitoring Stack Dashboard**: Dashboard count, active alerts, Alertmanager status

  - Set up alerting rules:

    Alerting rules were defined to detect critical issues:
    - The game down (level: 🔴 critical)
    - High CPU usage (level: 🟡 warning)
    - High heap memory usage (level: 🔵 info)
    - Event loop lag (level: 🟡 warning)
    - Unrachable services (level: 🟡 warning)

    These alerts are sent to both **AlertManager** center (http://localhost:9093) and [**Discord's Croiscendence server**](https://discord.gg/7Cda9VHh)

  - Secure access to Grafana (https://localhost:3003)

    Grafana's security was considered as an important part of this module to ensure that sensitive operational data is protected

    - Grafana runs only with **https** and behind authenticated access
    - Anonymous access to Grafana was disabled
    - Admin credentials are configured via *.env* variables and do not contain sensitive words like 'admin' or 'administrator'

### IX - Blockchain

#### 1. Major: Store tournament scores on the Blockchain (2 pts)

- **Motivation**:

  To ensure tournament results are immutable, transparent, and tamper-proof by storing final rankings on a public blockchain. This provides verifiable integrity of competitive outcomes and prevents any post-tournament manipulation of scores.
  
- **Details**:

  - Tournament results are stored on the Avalanche Fuji Testnet using a custom Solidity smart contract.
  - The smart contract is deployed on Remix IDE, enabling easy testing and verification on the Avalanche Fuji Testnet, and deployment transactions are signed and paid through the browser’s MetaMask extension
  - Each tournament can upload at most 8 rankings written on-chain via a secure owner-only transaction.
  - The backend integrates with the blockchain using ethers.js, supporting safe transaction queuing, duplicate detection, and robust error handling.
  - On-chain data can be queried individually or in bulk, allowing the application to verify and display tournament results directly from the blockchain.
  - Execute once on server startup, and keep uploading blockchain every minute with setInterval during runtime.

- **PIC**: layang


### X - Modules of choice

#### 1. Minor: JWT (Json Web Token) (1 pt)

- **Motivation**: For enhanced security, we have implemented a JWT-based system.
  
- **Details**:
  - Upon each login, a JWT is generated and stored in the cookies. It is valid for one hour and contains the user’s ID.
  - Using an addhook, the system checks on every page whether the JWT exists and is still valid.
  - If the token has expired or is invalid, the user is automatically logged out.
  - This JWT mechanism allows user information to be securely transmitted to the front-end.
