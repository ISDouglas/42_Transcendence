## Introduction

### The Project

**ft_transcendence**, nicknamed **Croiscendence**, is a multiplayer Pong game featuring
real-time matches and a tournament system.

The project focuses on building a complete full-stack web application, combining frontend, backend, database, real-time communication, authentication, and deployment.

### General Requirements

This project follows the official **ft_transcendence** subject requirements provided by 42, including mandatory features and optional modules.

### Technical Requirements

The application respects the technical constraints imposed by the subject, such as:
- A frontend that is clear, responsive, and accessible across all devices.
- Use a CSS framework or styling solution: **Tailwind CSS**
- Store credentials (API keys, environment variables, etc.) in a local **.env** file that is ignored by Git, and provide an **.env.example** file.
- The database have a clear schema and well-defined relations.
- User management system with sign up and login securely
  - Username, Email and Password authentication with hashed password, salted
  - Additional authentication: 2FA, OAuth 2.0 (Google)
- All forms and user inputs are properly validated in both the frontend and backend.
- HTTPS is used
- Docker-based deployment

---

### Individual Contributions

Each team member contributed to both core and optional features.  
Responsibilities included:
- Backend API development
- Frontend interface implementation
- Game logic and WebSocket communication
- Database design

## Description

### Overview

**Croiscendence** is a web-based multiplayer Pong game where players can:
- Authenticate securely
- Play real-time matches vs an AI or vs other players
- Participate in tournaments
- Track their performance

The goal of the project is to deliver a fun and competitive game while demonstrating solid full-stack engineering skills.

### Technical Stack

#### Frontend
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

#### Backend
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Fastify
- TypeScript

#### Database
- SQLite (chosen for simplicity, performance, and ease of deployment)

#### Other Technologies

**Technical choices were made to balance performance, simplicity, and compliance with the ft_transcendence subject constraints.**

---

### Database Schema

The database stores:
- Users (authentication data, profile, statistics)
- Matches (players, scores, results)
- Tournaments (participants, progression)

Relationships are designed to ensure data consistency and efficient queries.

---

### Key Features

- User authentication
- Real-time Pong gameplay
- Matchmaking system
- Tournament management
- Player statistics and profiles

Each feature was implemented collaboratively, with ownership depending on complexity
and workload distribution.

### Modules in Detail

- **Major Modules** (2 points each)
- **Minor Modules** (1 point each)

Each chosen module was selected to enhance the project’s educational value and gameplay experience.

#### VII - Devops

##### 1. Major Module: Monitoring system with Prometheus and Grafana (2 points)

- Motivation: This helps monitoring the server system, analyzing performance and informing the team immediately when there's a trouble in operation of the server and used services.

- Module in details:
  - Set up Prometheus to collect metrics
    
    Prometheus was deployed as the central metrics collector (http://localhost:9090)
    
  - Configure exporters and integrations

    - Node Exporter for collecting host-level metrics (http://localhost:9101)
    - cAdvisor for collecting container-level metrics (http://localhost:8080)
    - Backend (Fastify / Node.js) for collecting application-level metrics (https://localhost:3000/metrics)

  - Create custom Grafana dashboards:

    Grafana helps visualize the metrics through these custom dashboards below:
    - **Operation System Dashboard**: Host CPU, memory disk, network usage
    - **Container Dashboard**: CPU, memory, IO, network, resource usage per container
    - **Backend Dashboard**: Heap usage, event loop lag, request rate, latency...
    - **Monitoring Stack Dashboard**: Dashboard count, active alerts, Alertmanager status

  - Set up alerting rules:

    Alerting rules were defined to detect critical issues:
    - The game down (level: 🔴 critical)
    - High CPU usage (level: 🟡 warning)
    - High heap memory usage (level: 🔵 info)
    - Event loop lag (level: 🟡 warning)
    - Unrachable services (level: 🟡 warning)

    These alerts are sent to both **AlertManager** center (http://localhost:9093) and [**Discord's Croiscendence server**](https://discord.gg/7Cda9VHh)

  - Secure access to Grafana (https://localhost:3003)

    Grafana's security was considered as an important part of this module to ensure that sensitive operational data is protected

    - Grafana runs only with **https** and behind authenticated access
    - Anonymous access to Grafana was disabled
    - Admin credentials are configured via *.env* variables and do not contain sensitive words like 'admin' or 'administrator'

IV.1 Web





Major: Allow users to interact with other users. The minimum requirements are:
◦ A basic chat system (send/receive messages between users).
◦ A profile system (view user information).
◦ A friends system (add/remove friends, see friends list).

We chose this module because it contains important and relevant features for a gaming platform.

We implemented a general chat that allows users to communicate with all other connected users.
WebSockets enable real-time chat, available across all pages once the user is connected.
To ensure persistence, messages are stored in a database, with a limit of 25 messages (managed by a trigger that removes the oldest entry when a new one is added).
Messages are displayed in one color when a member sends a message and in another color when they receive one.
Multiple connections are also handled: if a user connects from multiple devices, the message bubbles remain consistent, and each message appears only once.

The friends page is divided into four sections:
- search bar: to add users – includes a debounce function to avoid excessive database calls.
- friends list: displays avatar, status (online/offline...), friendship date, and a button to delete a friend.
- pending invitations: display username, avatar, and request date (if less than 3 days: displayed as x seconds, x minutes, x hours, or x days ago), with accept and delete buttons.
- friend suggestions: other users with whom games have been played, limited to 20 suggestions.

SQL queries are used to build this page. The Friend table, which associates two users with information about their friendship (date, status), and the game_info table, used for friend suggestions, provide the necessary data to build this page.





IV.3 User Management


Major: Standard user management and authentication.
◦ Users can update their profile information.
◦ Users can upload an avatar (with a default avatar if none provided).
◦ Users can add other users ass friends and see their online status.
◦ Users have a profile page displaying their information




The avatar path is stored in the Users database.
A default path is set initially. Each time the avatar is updated, it is renamed as user_id.type.
Upload restrictions are enforced for file size and type (6 MB – PNG and JPEG).

On the friends page, users can send friend requests and view their friends along with their status.





IV.10 Modules of choice
Minor : JWT (Json Web Token)

For enhanced security, we have implemented a JWT-based system.
Upon each login, a JWT is generated and stored in the cookies. It is valid for one hour and contains the user’s ID.
Using an addhook, the system checks on every page whether the JWT exists and is still valid.
If the token has expired or is invalid, the user is automatically logged out.
This JWT mechanism allows user information to be securely transmitted to the front-end.
